## What is this project about?

My first project in Hexlet. "Brain Games— is a set of five console games. Each game asks questions that need to be answered correctly. The game is completed after three correct answers. Incorrect answers end the game and offer to go through it again. Games:

1. **Calculator:** Arithmetic expressions that need to be calculated.

2. **Progression:** find the missing number in the arithmetic progression

3. **Checking an even number**

4. **Find the greatest common divisor**

5. **Checking a prime number**
